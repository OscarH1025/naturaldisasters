# The Helping Hands Foundation

The Helping Hands Foundation is a foundation that sends supply packages such as food, water, clothes, toys, and other misc. supplies to charities or non-profit organizations through an e-commerce store web application. As a donor, you get to decide what supplies to donate so that those in need get the items they deserve. When purchasing from our variety of supply packages the donor can freely choose which items go to which organization.
